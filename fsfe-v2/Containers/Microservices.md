# Microservices

Architecture of loosely connected services

- Service which completes one task (does one thing)
- The opposite is a monolith applications

There are tradeoffs

Monolith pros

- maintainability
- cost of migrations
- engineering in one language

Microservices are based heavily on the concept of containers

Groovy is a flavor of Java
