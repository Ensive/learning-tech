// You are given a list of n numbers, where every number is at most k indexes away from its properly sorted index. Write a sorting algorithm (that will be given the number k) for this list that can solve this in O(n log k)

// Example:
// Input: [3, 2, 6, 5, 4], k=2
// Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
// As seen above, every number is at most 2 indexes away from its proper sorted index.

// Here's a starting point:

// def sort_partially_sorted(nums, k):
//   # Fill this in.

// print sort_partially_sorted([3, 2, 6, 5, 4], 2)
// # [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
