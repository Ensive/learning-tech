// Given a postorder traversal for a binary search tree, reconstruct the tree. A postorder traversal is a traversal order where the left child always comes before the right child, and the right child always comes before the parent for all nodes.

// Here's some starter code:

// class Node():
//   def __init__(self, value, left=None, right=None):
//     self.value = value
//     self.left = left
//     self.right = right

//   def __repr__(self):
//     return "(" + str(self.value) + ", " + self.left.__repr__() + ", " + self.right.__repr__() + ")"


// def create_tree(postorder):
//   # Fill this in.

// # 2 is the root node, with 1 as the left child and 3 as the right child
// print(create_tree([1, 3, 2]))
