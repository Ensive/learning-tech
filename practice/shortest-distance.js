// Given a string s and a character c, find the distance for all characters in the string to the character c in the string s. You can assume that the character c will appear at least once in the string.

// Here's an example and some starter code:

// def shortest_dist(s, c):
//   # Fill this in.

// print(shortest_dist('helloworld', 'l'))
// # [2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1]
