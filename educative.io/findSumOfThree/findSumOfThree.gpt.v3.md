## Space complexity

The space complexity of the “findSumOfThree” function is O(1) because the space used by the function is constant, regardless of the size of the input array. The function only uses a constant amount of space for storing variables such as “count”, “left”, “right”, and “sumOfThree”.

The space complexity of the “quickSort” function is O(log n) on average and O(n) in the worst case. This is because the function uses recursion to sort the array, which creates a new stack frame for each recursive call. The worst-case scenario occurs when the array is already sorted or nearly sorted, which results in a large number of recursive calls and a large stack size.

The space complexity of built-in JavaScript functions invoked by the code depends on the implementation of the JavaScript engine. However, in general, the space complexity of built-in functions such as “Array.isArray” and “typeof” is O(1) because they only perform simple operations on their inputs and do not create any new data structures.

## Time complexity

The time complexity of the function findSumOfThree is O(n^2) because it uses a nested loop to iterate over the array and check for the sum of three elements. The time complexity of the quickSort function is O(n log n) because it uses the quicksort algorithm. The time complexity of the built-in JavaScript functions Array.isArray and typeof is O(1) because they are simple operations that do not depend on the size of the input.

## Review code

The code looks good. The function takes an array of numbers and a target number as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there exist three numbers in the array that add up to the target number. The function first checks for invalid input and then sorts the array using the quicksort algorithm. It then uses the two pointers pattern to find the three numbers that add up to the target number. The time complexity of the function is O(n^2) due to the nested while loop. The space complexity is O(1) since the function only uses a constant amount of extra space.
