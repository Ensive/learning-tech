## Time complexity

Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. You are correct; there are indeed three nested loops in the code.

Let's break down the time complexity for each part:

1. Sorting the array: The sorting operation takes O(n log n) time, where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because the JavaScript `Array.sort()` method uses an efficient sorting algorithm such as quicksort or mergesort.

2. Outer loop: The outer loop iterates (n - 2) times, where n is the length of `nums`. This is because the last two elements in the array cannot form a valid triplet. Therefore, the time complexity of the outer loop is O(n).

3. Inner loops: The inner loops consist of two nested while loops. In the worst case, each while loop can iterate up to n/2 times, resulting in a total worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). However, it is important to note that the inner loops are bounded by the outer loop, so the overall time complexity remains O(n^2).

Therefore, considering all the parts, the overall time complexity of the code is O(n log n + n^2), which can be simplified to O(n^2) as it is the dominant term.

## Space complexity

The space complexity of the last code is O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`.

Here's the breakdown of the space usage in the code:

1. Result Array: The `result` array stores the triplets that sum up to the target. In the worst case, the number of valid triplets can be O(n^2), so the space required to store the result array is O(n^2). However, we can consider it as O(n) since we are not explicitly considering duplicates.

2. Sorting: The sorting operation is performed in-place on the input array `nums`, and it does not require any additional space. Therefore, the space complexity for sorting is O(1).

3. Variables: The space used by the loop variables and other constant variables is negligible and can be considered O(1).

Overall, the dominant factor in terms of space complexity is the `result` array, which requires O(n) space. Therefore, the space complexity of the code is O(n).
