# Complexity

The time complexity of the last code is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. The space complexity is O(n).

Here's the breakdown of the time and space complexities:

1. Sorting: The sorting operation on `nums` takes O(n log n) time complexity. This is the dominant factor in the time complexity.

2. Outer loop: The outer loop iterates through the array `nums` and has a time complexity of O(n).

3. Inner while loop: The inner while loop executes at most O(n) iterations in total. This is because, for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop can traverse at most the entire remaining part of the array once. Therefore, the inner while loop contributes O(n) to the time complexity.

Overall, the dominant factor is the sorting operation, giving the code a time complexity of O(n log n + n^2), which simplifies to O(n^2).

Regarding space complexity:

1. Sorting: The sorting operation is performed in-place, meaning it does not require additional space. Hence, the space complexity for sorting is O(1).

2. Result Set: The `result` Set stores the unique triplets, which can have at most O(n^2) entries in the worst case. Therefore, the space complexity for the `result` Set is O(n^2).

3. Other variables: The remaining variables used in the code take constant space and can be considered O(1) in total.

The dominant factor in terms of space complexity is the `result` Set, contributing O(n^2) space. Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n^2).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(n^2)
